# KP_Responsive_Landing-page

Hello everyone! 

This is a part of challenge form CSS Guru Kevin Powell's "Conquering Responsive Layouts 21 days" free lesson.
I wanted to practice everything I learnt from him and add some personal touch to this challenge. (aka animations)

- Mobil first approach
- Responsive design
- SASS and BEM 
- JavaScript
